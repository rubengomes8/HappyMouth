# HappyMouth

This is a project which I created to learn a bit of React native, and explore its capabilities. 

The goal of  this  project is to create an app that allows the user to create a recipe by providing some informations, such as the ingredients. The [backend](https://github.com/rubengomes8/HappyMouthBackend) uses the OpenAI api to generate the recipe. 

### Demo
Check the demo video [here](quick_demo.mov)!

### Backend
You can check the corresponding backend [here](https://github.com/rubengomes8/HappyMouthBackend). 

### Set up (with yarn)
``` yarn expo start ```

### TODOs
- Use sign up with google email
- use .env to create env variables to replace hardcoded IPs
- use react query to cache ingredients api result
- allow user to submit requests for new ingredients
